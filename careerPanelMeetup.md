## Market

- Less Demand more supply of junior developers in the market
- Many companies are starting to carve a path for NSS grads and junior developers
- Companies turning to grab a couple of junior developers rather than waiting to find the onee senior developer to fill a position and business needs
- Question brough up: As a junior dev, should you apply to the mid or sr role that is posted on the job board?  Answer:  Call the company and ask questions regarding the position. In some cases you may be able to go ahead and apply, some may not.
- Some persons coming out of NSS may be a strong junior and could apply for the mid-level
- If you bomb an interview at a higher level it doesn't necessarily mean that you wouldn't be hired by the same company in a different role that fits you better

## Questions to Ask the Company during Interview

- Ask questions in order to figure out how learning and growth is encouraged.
- This is very important to ask if nothing else.  You want to be sure you find a place that encourages growth and learning.
- Are you able to watch udemy at work?
- What is the onboarding process?
- Do they pair you with a mentor?
- Many companies will script the first 90 days so you are guided on your strengths and weaknesses and can improve.
- What ongoing training do they provide?
- Do they allow/encourage you to go to conferences related to dev?
- What does the growth/promotion look like at the company?
- Discuss what kind of work you will be doing

## Company Fit

- Do not settle for any job that comes along.  You want to be sure you find the right job for your goals.
- Always be thinking about what you can learn if you accept the position, how does it align with your end goal?
- Take a trial period with a company to be sure it is one that fits and don't be afraid to switch in 6 months to a year if it is not what you are looking for
- "Work to learn, not work to earn"
- Keep an eye on the story of your resume.  Be able to explain what and why if asked.

## Resumes

- Be careful what you put on your resume
- Only put experience with tools and languages that you understand.
- Be honest about the level of experience with different languages
- Not best to put a language on your resume if you haven't used it much
- Spell check and check your grammar.  If there are errors it leads the hiring manager to believe you are not attentive to details
- Make sure your contact information is included on the resume and is correct, at a minimum keep your email and phone number
- Tailor your resume to the job you are applying for, you may need to tweak a few items before submitting
- Highlight metrics on resume
- Keep it short, even long term professionals in the field can keep it down to 1 page
- Get help with resume, do not send out blindly.  Get as much feedback on it as possible prior to submission.
- If you include a github link make sure the code is ready to be read

## Interviews

- Be ready to critique the code of others.
- How would you challenge a senior developer?
- Juniors are typically learning at an accelerated pace.  Try to link what you do know, and the languages you have learned, time that you learned them in and apply to learning new languages.
- If the interview question is a short answer, yes or no, try to expand and talk about the topic on a broader scale.
- If you are stumped on a question or don't know what you are being asked, ask the interviewer.  Once they give an explanation see if you can then show how you have some experience in that area or something similar.
- If you have a phone interview and are not able to answer all of the questions, be sure to follow up and find the answer to that question. Then you can use that information in hopefully a follow up face to face interview or another form of communication.
- Tell your resume story, be able to explain the why's

## Culture Fit

- One of the most important things when looking for a company
- What type of environment will you be working in?
- Know what type of culture you are looking for and what you like or don't like.
- Ask questions to find out the company culture
- How are decisions made? 
- How are conflicts resolved?
- Do your teams go to lucnh, where are some of their favorite places?
- Do teams hang out after work?
- What does the work-life balance look like?
- Contract jobs can be a good way to try a company on for size.

## Additional questions

- How to best use non-tech experience within resume and interviews?
- Answer: You are able to better see from the perspective of the end user.  Use the soft skills (people skills) that you have learned in your past roles.  Does not hurt you during interviews and can help show your empathy toward the customer of products you may be asked to work on.
